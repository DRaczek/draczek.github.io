Welcome to my personal portfolio website! 🎉  
This site is a place where I share a bit about myself, my projects, and my journey as a developer.  

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m an aspiring software developer who has recently graduated from technical school and started my computer science studies at university.  

My journey began in primary school, where I first got interested in coding and solving math problems. That curiosity eventually led me to enroll in a technical secondary school with a focus on software development. During those years, I discovered and deepened my passion for programming and technology — building small apps, experimenting with code, and learning how things work under the hood. I enjoy solving problems, whether it’s through writing clean code, automating tasks, or bringing an idea to life on the screen.

Although I don’t have much professional experience yet, I’m eager to learn by doing. I take every project, no matter how small, as an opportunity to grow my skills and challenge myself. My main focus right now is building a solid foundation in programming, understanding core computer science concepts, and exploring different areas of software development to find what excites me the most.  

Outside of coding, I’m curious about technology trends, enjoy working on personal projects, and like collaborating with others to share knowledge and ideas.
